        <h3>FAQ of a Leap Year Day Baby</h3>
        <p>Though it’s not <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births">particularly uncommon</a> for a baby to be born on any individual Leap Year Day (February 29), that day is the planet’s least common birthday, as only every four years or so does it grace the second page of monthly calendars.</p>
        <p>I consider myself lucky to have been born on February 29. My birthday is the world’s best icebreaker <em>fun fact about yourself</em> - interesting enough to generate small talk but impersonal enough to share with a stranger. Here, sharing with a stranger is what I’ll do with you, as I answer some of the top questions I get about being born on Leap Year Day.</p>
        <h4>How does that work, again?</h4>
        <p>This topic, unsurprisingly, was of unusual interest for me in elementary school, but I understand that not everyone remembers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">the details</a>.</p>
        <p>The Earth takes some 364.242196 days to complete a revolution around the sun. Because that’s not a nice, round number, over many years the seasons will shift in the calendar year. Imagine Minnesota’s leaves donning their brilliant autumn colors in January or a <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/dangerous-travel-conditions-power-outages-caused-by-snow-and-ice-cripple-coastal-south-carolina/article_fbca297a-f070-11e7-bdd2-5f83e31fbf0a.html">South Carolina snowfall</a> in September. How difficult planning would be!</p>
        <p>Cultures around the world developed various solutions to the season shifting problem. Our Gregorian Calendar uses the leap year day. In years divisible by 4 or 400 but not by 100, add an extra day at the end of February. The years 2016 and 2020 were leap years. The years 2017, 2018, and 2019 were not. The years 1600 and 2000 were leap years. The years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not. God willing, I’ll live to see 2100 (a non-leap year) and 2104 (the soonest leap year thereafter). Exciting!</p>
        <h4>So, what are you, like [2, 15, some other number that is not a young adult’s age divided by 4]?</h4>
        <p>I don’t begrudge people for guessing. Surprise mental math is no fun. I do, however, hear some unusual guesses.</p>
        <p>I’ll be 6&frac14; this year! It’s good fun to use the fractional ages popular with school age children. Should I live 72 or even 84 years, I’ll be sure to buy a lottery ticket for my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday and have a beer for my 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
        <h4>Do you celebrate on February 28 or March 01?</h4>
        <p>To be honest, I think birthday celebration is a little overrated, and I don’t much care for the attention it can bring.</p>
        <p>That said, I’m no curmudgeon! Leap year day birthdays are best celebrated on the true day-of, every fourth year, with a little extravagance.</p>
        <p>For what it’s worth, every jurisdiction in which I’ve lived has considered my legal birthday in non-leap years to be March 01.</p>
        <h4>Does your birthday ever give you any trouble?</h4>
        <p>When I was little, some software and websites failed to properly handle leap year day birthdays. I remember a particular disappointment that I couldn’t register a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/kids">LEGO.com</a> profile with my actual birthday.</p>
        <p>Other places handle this birthday with special consideration. At some point in my childhood, I wound up at a <a href="https://www.buildabear.com/">Build-A-Bear Workshop</a> birthday party. While this might have otherwise been unremarkable (I was more of a sports and space and stegosauruses kind of child), I remember fondly that company sending me a “My Leap Day B-day was un-FUR-gettable!” t-shirt in the mail some years after my visit. Very kind!</p>
        <p>Still common today is the web form that won’t allow the user to enter February 29 as a date of birth without first entering a year. This can be a nuisance when the <var>year</var> field is listed separately after <var>month</var> and <var>day</var> fields. This kind of bug has never caused me too much trouble, but it does serve as a personal reminder of the importance of writing usable software. As I write software, I must strive to address edge and corner cases so that the product meets the needs of all intended users.</p>
