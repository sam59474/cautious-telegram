        <h3>Fun with the Second-Person Plural</h3>
        <p>As a man who grew up in exurban parts of the American South, while some characteristics of my speech fit into an emerging, more homogenous dialect of 21<sup>st</sup> century American English, other parts of my speech are distinctly Southern.</p>
        <p>My senior year of high school, I’d step out of my first period calculus class to do the school’s morning announcements. I’d get compliments for my “radio voice”, which I think was overstated but nonetheless implied a certain neutrality.</p>
        <p>Moving to the Midwest after college, though, few would mistake me for a local, and, sure enough, on the excellent <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html">dialect map quiz</a> from the New York Times, I scored a fairly accurate Greenville, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Birmingham, Alabama.
        <h4>The Word <em>Y’all</em></h4>
        <p>It’s all well and good to be <em>fixing to</em> push the <em>buggy</em> over to the drink aisle to pick up some <em>cokes</em> for the party, sure, but my favorite feature of Southern American English is one of its best known: the second-person plural pronoun <em>y’all</em>.</p>
        <p>It’s a smooth word, natural and generally friendly, and ever useful. Delightfully, it fills an uncomfortable void in more formal conjugation charts:</p>
I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, y’all are, they are
        <p>It has a comparably regional analogue in Spanish, at least, too:</p>
Yo soy, t’u eres, e’l/ella/usted es; nosotros somos, vosotros seis, ellos/ellas/ustedes son
        <p>Recently, I’ve met some activist types who have adopted <em>y’all</em> as a gender-neutral replacement for <em>you guys</em>. To that I say, “Welcome aboard, y’all!” I’d like to elaborate two standards for usage that I think are commonly misunderstood.</p>
        <h4><em>Y’all</em> vs <em>All Y’all</em></h4>
        <p>There’s an underwhelming joke that sometimes gets published in places like <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/state-jokesReader’s Digest listicles (https://www.rd.com/list/state-jokes/):

Y’all is singular. All y’all is plural. All y’all’s is plural possessive.

Humor (or lack thereof) aside, this is just plain wrong. Both y’all and all y’all are plural. The difference is specificity. Y’all addresses a group at large. All y’all addresses individually each member of a group.

For example, if I ask a group of four friends, Did y’all see Dark Waters starring Mark Ruffalo?https://youtu.be/RvAOuhyunhY, it would be appropriate for two who have seen the film to respond affirmatively and the other two to remain silent. The group at large acknowledges the existence of the film.

On the other hand, if I ask a group of four friends, Did all y’all see The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch?, https://youtu.be/nuPZUUED5uk, I want to know individually whether each of the four present has seen the film. Perhaps I wish to know whether it would be appropriate to discuss spoilers, or if viewing would be novel and fun for all involved.

Apostrophe Placement

First and foremost, there’s never a reason to put the apostrophe in y’all after the a. I won’t even reprint that abomination here.

Second, a bit about the second-person plural possessive. I’ve never seen this laid out formally, so I would propose this rule: the word y’alls needs no second apostrophe https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/apostrophe_introduction.html. It is independently possessive in character, just as is the unadorned third-person singular possessive its.

Language is of course fluid and ever-evolving, but it’s important for computer programmers in particular to use language carefully and within well defined parameters. It’s been a pleasure to share with y’all two less clear rules for one of my favorite words.
